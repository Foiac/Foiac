## 😁 Hi there 👋

I'm Caio França, and I love software development and automation processes. I'm an Electrical and Automation Engineer currently working as a Team Lead at F1rst Digital Service (Santander Brazil). With 6 years of experience in technology, I've been involved in hardware and software development, exploring various exciting projects with different technologies.

## 🎯 Expertise 📈

With technology in my blood and a passion for the financial market, I see the intersection of these two worlds as the construction of a fair and promising society. I strongly believe that empathy, honest, and sincere communication are the keys to resolving conflicts and building bridges between the most diverse people and cultures.

In my professional journey, I worked as a technology teacher, teaching computer science and programming to children, teenagers, and university students. I had the opportunity to contribute to international projects for the automation of industrial turbines for power generation. As the main result, I developed a sales standard that started to be used worldwide.

Taking a step closer to technology and the financial world, I worked to support digital channels (mobile banking, internet banking), developing Java/Spring applications for collecting and persisting business data. I reached the role of responsible squad leader by overseeing the collection of transactional data, which was then sent, transformed with Python/Spark, and loaded into a data lake. This data lake serves both to fuel transactional journeys and for business analysis to support decision making.

Today, as my greatest ambition, I aim to advance in my career, always considering the impact on as many people as possible by generating value in processes and products that have a life of their own, independent of my presence
